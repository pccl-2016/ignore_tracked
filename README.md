# ignore_tracked
A repository to practice ignoring files that are already tracked by Git

Try to ignore the files that end with .fti. These files have been added to the repo, but because of some reasons, we don't want Git to keep tracking them. How can we remove them from the repo and ask Git to stop tracking them? Note that they still exist in the commit history.
